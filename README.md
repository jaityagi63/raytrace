# Python Raytracer

This is a simple raytracer implemented in Python using `numpy` for vector operations and `Pillow` for image generation.

## Setup
It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running
Run the improved raytracer script:

```bash
python raytracer.py
```

This will generate `raytracer_output.png` which contains the rendered scene with:
- Spheres
- Recursive reflections
- Shadows
- Blinn-Phong shading
